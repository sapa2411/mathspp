# Blog

Check out the hundreds of articles I published on my [blog](/blog).

There, you can find articles mostly about programming and mathematics.

From the [“Pydon't 🐍” articles](/blog/pydonts) that help you write better Python code,
to the series of [biweekly problems](/blog/problems) that get your brain smoking 🤯,
to everything in between!

You can also take a look at a [random article](/random)!

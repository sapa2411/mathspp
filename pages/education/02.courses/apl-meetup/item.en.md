The weekly APL meetup has the purpose of getting people together to learn APL.
There are already some places online where people can go and learn, and those
are typically in English.
The APL weekly meetup started as a way for Portuguese speakers to get together
and learn APL, a universal tool of thought.

The first session is scheduled for the 1st of March, 2021.

A more detailed programme and executive summaries of the sessions will be
added here as the event progresses.

# Mathspp

### A corner of the internet dedicated to maths and programming.
  
<br />

### The purpose

I started the mathspp blog as a way to share my side projects with people. Not because I thought a lot of people would care about those side projects, but because I wanted to be able to share them with whomever showed interest. Soon after starting it out my love for mathematics and science communication took over and I started writing about a lot of other things other than programming projects I made...

Now this site and its blog are all about me trying to share my passion for mathematics and programming and me trying to show that those two things are:

 1. not subjects for Gods...
 2. complementary...
 3. and quite enjoyable!

### The name

*mathspp* is supposed to be a play on the scope of the material in this website. *Maths* clearly refers to mathematics and the *++* is a reference to programming. The domain is `mathspp.com` because the `p` stands for *plus*; this is also similar to what happens in the world of programming, as can be seen by the `.cpp` extension of `C++` files, for example.

### The people
  
All the content in the mathspp website is brought to you by [Rodrigo Gir達o Serr達o](https://linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-gir達o-serr達o) unless explicitly stated. The server side of things is handled by my friend [Pineman](https://pineman.eu) who is incredibly helpful, generous and patient with me (Thanks!).

### The technologies

The website is powered by [grav](https://getgrav.org) and the content is mostly written in [Markdown syntax](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/content/markdown) with a bit of HTML/CSS/JavaScript here and there.
 
### Typography

Headers: [Chewy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Chewy)

Paragraphs: [Miriam Libre](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Miriam+Libre)

### Images

The images are mostly from the [freeimages.com](https://freeimages.com) and [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) websites.

The minor editing I perform on images or other graphical objects is mostly done over at [lunapic.com](https://lunapic.com) and whenever I make a GIF out of a set of images I use [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com).

All the diagrams, schemes, sketches and graphical elements I compose myself are more often than not done with *very* advanced tools like MS Paint and MS Power Point.

### Icons

The icons used over at the [workshops page](https://mathspp.com/workshops) are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

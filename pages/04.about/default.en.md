## Building Bridges Between Mathematics and Programming

The mathspp blog started as a way to share my side projects with people.
Not because I thought a lot of people would care about those side projects,
but because I wanted to be able to share them with whomever showed interest.
Soon after starting, my love for mathematics and science communication took over
and I started writing about a lot of other things other than programming projects I made.

Nowadays this site, and the blog, are all about me trying to share my passion for mathematics
and programming, and also show that mathematics and programming complement each other nicely.

!!! Did you know that “mathspp” is a word play on the two main subjects of interest:
!!! mathematics and programming.
!!! “pp” is a reference to C++, alluding to programming, and the “pp” appended to “maths”
!!! can also be interpreted as my attempt to make mathematics more interesting by
!!! complementing it with mathematics.


### The Author

![A picture of my face.](rgs.jpg?resize=300,400&classes=float-right)

My name is [Rodrigo Girão Serrão][linkedin], I am from [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal)
and I am a mathemagician and a programmer.
I studied mathematics at the university level and whenever I was given the opportunity to choose,
I tried to stay close to programming, focusing my studies on applied mathematics, numerical methods,
and related areas.

I like to spend my time with the people I love, I like to teach and share knowledge,
read fantasy and technical books, write code and watch silly comedy movies.


### Contacts

You can drop me a line by clicking the @ at the bottom of the page, which opens
a window for you to send an email to mathsppblog (at) gmail (dot) com.
Feel free to write me with ideas, comments, feedback, praises and criticism!


### Support the Project

If you are reading this, thank you so much.
If you would like to support the mathspp project, one of the nicest things you could do
is write me an email to let me know you have been enjoying my work.
I am only human, and knowing that there are people that read (and enjoy) what I write
helps me stay motivated.
You can also share this website with your friends, colleagues, communities you
are a part of, so that it reaches more people who want to learn mathematics and programming.
Finally, if you believe this is a very important project and/or if you would like to make
a material contribution, you can consider [supporting me on Patreon][patreon].


### The Technologies Used

The website is powered by [grav] and the content is mostly written in Markdown syntax.
I also use some HTML/CSS/JavaScript to further customise some behaviour.


### Typography

The fonts were taken from [Google Fonts][google-fonts], the headings use the [Chewy] font family,
and the text uses [Miriam Libre][miriam-libre].


### Images and Icons

I take many free images from the [Unsplash] and [Free Images][free-images] websites.
You should be able to see the image credit if you hover it; if you don't, let me know:
I probably placed it by mistake as the alternative text for the image.

Scattered throughout the website you can also find some neat icons, those are
from the free version of [Font Awesome][font-awesome].

Sometimes I do minor editing (online, in-browser) at [Lunapic] and I often build
GIFs at [ezgif].
For editing that is even simpler, I also use powerful tools like MS Paint.
I also create some graphical content with [Canva].

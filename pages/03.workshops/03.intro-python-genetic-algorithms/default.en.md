# Introduction to Python with evolutionary algorithms

## Aim

The aim of this workshop is to introduce people to programming. Instead of introducing the concepts point-blank, we use evolutionary algorithms as a motivation for the concepts taught.

We will take randomly generated cleaning "robots", such as the one seen here:

![Gif with a robot randomly walking around a rectangular grid](initial_robot.gif)

and try to use ideas borrowed from Darwin's theory of evolution, to create better cleaning robots, like the one seen here:

By the end of the workshop, the participant will have finished a basic genetic algorithm that evolves the first robot into the second.

The code can be found over at [my workshops repository][github-repo].

# What is next..?

I _really_ like teaching and sharing knowledge and talking in public! And I have some skills on those topics, so if you want to invite me to lead a workshop/talk a little bit about science (especially mathematics and computation, as those are the sciences that I know something about), [invite me](mailto:mathspp@mathspp.com)!

I have several interests and if you want me to talk about something I haven't learned it, it is an excellent opportunity to learn! I find it particularly enjoyable when my audience is composed of middle school, high school or college-level students. Maybe it is because I never had a nice audience composed of adults...

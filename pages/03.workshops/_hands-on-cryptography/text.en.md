title: Hands-on cryptography
---

In this hands-on workshop I have one single objective in mind: have everyone encoding and deciphering messages with the several techniques I teach.

Whether we use more basic or advanced techniques, whether we do everything with pen and paper or with the help of our programming skills, this workshop ends up being very dynamic and a lot of fun when everyone tries to crack the harder, longer messages.

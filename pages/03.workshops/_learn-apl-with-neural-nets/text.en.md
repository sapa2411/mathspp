menu: Learn APL with neural nets
---

In this workshop you get to learn Dyalog APL, a programming language that is completely different from what you have seen already, as it

 - evaluates from right to left,
 - contains "weird" symbols like `⍋`, `⌽` and `⍣` and
 - is purely array-oriented.

This will have you coding in a completely different mindset. You will exercise this mindset in implementing a neural network from scratch that, by the end of the workshop, will take a look at images like the ones on the right and will recognise the digits that are written in them.

Here's what a couple of people said about the workshop:

 > “*The best thing was to have this hands-on approach to learning a new programming language*”  &mdash; Carlos

 > “*I really enjoyed the simple and accessible way in which it was taught*”  &mdash; Anonymous

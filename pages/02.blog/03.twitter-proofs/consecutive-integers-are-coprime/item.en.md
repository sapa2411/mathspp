Let's prove that if $k$ is an integer, then $\gcd(k, k+1) = 1$. That is, any two consecutive integers are coprime.

### Twitter proof

Let $k$ be an integer and let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $k$ and $k + 1$.
We have that $(k + 1)/d = k/d + 1/d$ and both $(k + 1)/d$ and $k/d$ are integers, so $1/d$ must be an integer and we can only have $d = 1$.

Do you have an idea for a twitter proof? Let me know in the comments below!

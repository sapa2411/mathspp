Can you draw 4 triangles in this 5 by 5 grid, covering all dots?

===

# Problem statement

Your challenge is to draw 4 triangles in a regular 5 by 5 grid.
Of course, there are some restrictions:

 - all vertices of all triangles have to lie on the dots;
 - all 25 dots have to be covered by the vertices/edges of the triangles; and
 - no triangle may have a right angle
 (thus, the image above is a bad start: the triangle to the right has a right angle).

!!! Give it some thought!

If you need any clarification whatsoever, feel free to ask in the comment section below.

Can you help these kids trick or treat their entire neighbourhood in this Halloween special?

# Problem statement

It's Halloween night.
Jack, Frank, and their 98 friends are getting ready to trick or treat their entire neighbourhood.

This year, the group of 100 friends decided they wanted to be very efficient...
Hence, tonight they won't be walking together as a huge group.
Instead, they'll be having fun at the park, and each friend will visit one of the 100 houses of the neighborhood at a time.

The 100 friends agreed on assigning one house per friend, so as to maximise the amount of candy they could get.
Jack is the first to go, but completely forgets the house he was assigned, so he decides to go trick or treating a random house instead.
From there on, throughout the night, each friend would go to their assigned house, unless one of the other friends already went there.
If that's the case, the friend will just pick one of the remaining houses randomly.

Frank is the last of the 100 friends to go.
What is the probability that Frank will go trick-or-treating at the house he was assigned originally?

!!! Give it some thought!

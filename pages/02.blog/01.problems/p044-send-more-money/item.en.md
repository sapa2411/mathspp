Can you solve this simple-looking arithmetic challenge?

===

![A piece of paper where one can read "SEND + MORE = MONEY".](thumbnail.png)

# Problem statement

The image above represents an arithmetic calculation:

SEND + MORE = MONEY

Each letter represents a unique digit,
and each word represents a number with as many digits as letters
(there are no leading 0s).

Can you figure out the numeric value of each word?

!!! Give it some thought!

If you need any clarification whatsoever, feel free to ask in the comment section below.

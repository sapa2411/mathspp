# Problem statement

Three friends, Alice, Bob, and Charlie, are assigned three different
positive whole numbers by their fourth friend, Diane.
Furthermore, Diane told them that their three numbers add up to 12
and that Charlie's is the largest one.

Diane then asks the three of them if they know everyone's numbers,
to which Bob replies “I do!”, whereas Alice and Charlie remain silent.
After Bob's revelation, Alice and Charlie think for a couple of seconds
and confirm that now they also know everyone's numbers.

What were Alice's, Bob's, and Charlie's numbers?


!!! Give it some thought!

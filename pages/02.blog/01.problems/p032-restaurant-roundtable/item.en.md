title: "Problem #032 - restaurant roundtable"
---

A waiter at a restaurant gets a group's order completely wrong.
Can you turn the table to get two or more orders right?

### Problem statement

An arbitrary number of people are people sitting down, around a round table,
waiting for their orders.
When the waiter brings their orders, they mix everything up and no single
person is served what they ordered.

Can you _always_ turn the table so that at least two orders are correctly aligned?
You can start by trying with the example in the figure above, assuming
you are not colour-blind (sorry if you are :/).

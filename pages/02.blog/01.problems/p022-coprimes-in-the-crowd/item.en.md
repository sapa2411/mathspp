This simple problem is an example of a very interesting phenomenon: if you have a large enough "universe" to consider, even randomly picked parts exhibit structured properties.

### Problem statement

Say you have the first $2n$ positive integers,

$$
\{1, 2, 3, \cdots, 2n-1, 2n\}\ .
$$

Show that, if you pick $n + 1$ from those, you always have two numbers that will share no divisors whatsoever.

In other words, show that there's two of those $n+1$ numbers that are coprime.

!!! Give it some thought...

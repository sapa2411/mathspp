It's night time and 4 friends need to cross a fragile bridge,
but they only have one torch.
What's the order in which they should cross?

# Problem statement

4 friends are doing some trekking by night,
when they hit a rope bridge that they need to cross.

They decide that it is best if only 2 cross at a time,
because the bridge looks really fragile,
and the bridge has some holes in it,
so they better only cross if they have any way of lighting their way.
Because the friends only have a single torch, they figure out that
every time 2 people cross to the other side, someone has to come back
with the torch, which will cost them some time...

The 4 friends want to cross that bridge as fast as possible.
How can they do that if they each take 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes to cross the bridge?

!!! Give it some thought!

### Problem statement

Today's problem is a classical one.
If you solve lots of logic puzzles and riddles then it is likely
that you already know this one, but here it goes for the others that do not know it yet:

Two identical doors are in front of you.
One of them is between you and eternal happiness, whereas the other one will give you eternal sadness if you cross it.

Furthermore, there are two people close by, and they know which door is which.
You are allowed to ask one of those persons a single question.
However, one of the persons always lies and the other person always tells the truth.

What question should you ask in order to determine the correct door?

Can you solve this little minesweeper puzzle?

![4 by 4 minesweeper grid containing, from left to right, top to bottom: 2, gray, 1, gray, gray, gray, 3, gray, 3, gray, gray, gray, gray, 1, gray, 1](thumbnail.png)

# Problem statement

The [xkcd] website published its cartoon [#2496][source], containing a minesweeper grid,
and that is the problem for this post:
to locate all of the mines in the minesweeper grid above.

For those of you who don't know the minesweeper game,
here are the rules:

 - some squares contain mines, others don't;
 - squares that do not contain mines contain numbers instead,
and those numbers indicate how many mines are neighbours to that numbered square
(the neighbourhood of a square contains the squares that are directly
adjacent to it, plus the squares that share a vertex in the diagonal).
 - gray squares can contain mines or other numbers.

You must find all the mines by reasoning about the numbers you see.

You can play minesweeper online or you can play [my minesweeper remake][minesweeper-blog].

!!! Give it some thought!

If you need any clarification whatsoever, feel free to ask in the comment section below.

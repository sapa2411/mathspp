You are sunbathing when you decide to go and talk to some friends
under a nearby sun umbrella, but first you want to get your
feet wet in the water.
What is the most efficient way to do this?

### Problem statement

The problem statement is just like you read above.
You are on the sand and need to go to another place on the sand,
but first you need to go to the shoreline, which you can assume
is a straight line:

How do you pick your path so that you walk as little as possible
(because the sand is really hot!)?

!!! Give it some thought...

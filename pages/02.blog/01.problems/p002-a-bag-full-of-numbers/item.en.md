Two friends were bored and decided to play a game... a mathematical game with a paper bag!

### Problem statement

John and Mary have a bag full of integer numbers. In fact, the bag has $10^{10^{10}}$ integers, each written on a plastic card, and the sum of all the $10^{10^{10}}$ integers in the bag is $0$. In turns, Mary and John are going to play with the bag by doing the following:

 - Picking two cards from the bag with numbers $a$ and $b$ and removing them from the bag;
 - Inserting a new card in the bag with the number $a^3 + b^3$.

Is there any initial number configuration and/or set of moves for which it is possible that, after $10^{10^{10}} - 1$ moves, the only card in the bag has the number $73$?

!!! Give it some thought... and most important of all, try it for real! Let me know how it went in the comment section below ;)

!!!! **Hint**: the answer is "no". Can you show why?

!!!! **Hint**: look for an invariant of the game! That is, find a property of the game that does _not_ change when Mary and John play it.

In [this post][wbr post] I talked about the riddle of the water buckets. Now I challenge you to prove that in some situations it is _impossible_ to solve it!

### Problem statement

You have $n$ buckets, each bucket with capacity for $c_i$ litres of water, $i = 1, \cdots, n$. You want to manipulate the buckets in such a way that one of them holds exactly $t$ litres of water, knowing that the only moves you can do are:

 - completely fill up bucket $i$ so that it holds $c_i$ litres of water;
 - completely empty bucket $i$ so that it now holds $0$ litres of water;
 - move water from bucket $i$ to bucket $j$, until bucket $i$ becomes empty or bucket $j$ becomes full, whatever happens first.

Prove that, if $t$ is not a multiple of the greatest common divisor of the $c_i$, $i = 1, \cdots, n$ then it is impossible for a single bucket to hold exactly $t$ litres of water.

For example, if the buckets have capacities $4$ and $6$ and $t = 3$, then you can't perform the moves above to get exactly $3$ litres of water into one of the two buckets as the greatest common divisor of $4$ and $6$ is $\gcd(4, 6) = 2$ and $3$ is _not_ a multiple of $2$.

!!! Give it some thought... and give it an actual shot! Take out a piece of paper and a pencil and get your brain working!

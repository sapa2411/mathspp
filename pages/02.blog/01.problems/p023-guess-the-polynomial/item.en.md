In this problem you have to devise a strategy to beat the computer in a "guess the polynomial" game.

===

<script>
    var max_degree = 5;
    var max_coef = 3;

    // Generate a random integer between a and b, inclusive.
    randint = function(a, b) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random()*(1+b-a)) + a;
    }

    var poly = [];
    generate_poly = function() {
        poly = [];
        for (var i = 0; i <= max_degree; ++i) {
            poly.push(randint(0, max_coef));
        }
    }

    window.onload = generate_poly;
</script>

### Problem statement

I want you to play a little game with the computer. The computer is going to think of a polynomial of degree at most $5$ with non-negative, integer coefficients.
All the coefficients will be less than $4$.
Let's say $p(n)$ is the secret polynomial the computer is thinking of.

With the restrictions I imposed, we have

$$
p(n) = c_0 + c_1n + c_2n^2 + c_3n^3 + c_4n^4 + c_5n^5
$$

with $0 \leq c_i \leq 3$.

You can ask the computer to compute $p(n)$ for any non-negative integer you'd like.
Your task is to devise a strategy that allows you to determine $c_0, \cdots, c_5$ after a sequence of questions you ask the computer.
In particular, I want you to devise the *best* strategy possible for this game.
You can play with the computer here:

<button onclick="generate_poly">Create a new polynomial</button>

!!! Give it a try!

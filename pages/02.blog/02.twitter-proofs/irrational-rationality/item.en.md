title: 'Twitter proof: irrational rationality'
---

Let's prove that there are two irrational numbers, call them $a$ and $b$, such that $a^b$ is a rational number! And let's do it in a tweet.

### Twitter proof

Let $a = b = \sqrt 2$. If $a^b$ is rational, then we are done; if not, take $a = \sqrt 2^{\sqrt 2}$ and $b = \sqrt 2$. Notice how $a^b = (\sqrt2 ^ \sqrt2)^{\sqrt 2} = (\sqrt 2)^2 = 2$ which is obviously rational. So we have shown such $a$ and $b$ exist, even though we don't know if we should take $a = b = \sqrt 2$ or $a = \sqrt 2^{\sqrt 2}, b = \sqrt 2$.

And the actual tweet with the proof:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter proof:<br>Let a=b=√2. If a^b is rational then there is nothing to be done. Assume a^b is irrational. Redefine a=√2^√2. Notice how a^b = (√2^√2)^√2 = (√2)^2 = 2 which is clearly rational.

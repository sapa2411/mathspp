# About

“Syncro is an immersive, soothing and brain-teasing experience.
This game challenges logical reasoning by the use of mathematics, conveying a graphical representation of a principle in the Automata Theory.”

This game can be played [online][syncro-online] and is also available as an [Android app][syncro-android].
The game was developed by my friend [Mathgurl][mathgurl] and [RawEgg][rawegg].

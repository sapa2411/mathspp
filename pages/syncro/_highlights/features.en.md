# Syncro

“Syncro is an immersive, soothing and brain-teasing experience.
This game challenges logical reasoning by the use of mathematics, conveying a graphical representation of a principle in the Automata Theory.”

This game can be played [online][syncro-online] and is also available as an [Android app](https://play.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.RawEgg.Syncro).
The game was developed by my friend [Mathgurl][mathgurl] and [RawEgg][rawegg].

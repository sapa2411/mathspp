title: Introduction to LaTeX
---

You can think of LaTeX as Microsoft Word for scientists. With LaTeX we can create complex documents in a simpler manner.

For example, for mathematicians it makes it easy to write beautiful formulas, like this one: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \iff x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

Nowadays we can even use (some) LaTeX over at Facebook Messenger (even though it doesn't work on mobile phones): try sending `$$x^2 - 1 = 0$$` to someone, and see it become $x^2 - 1 = 0$.
